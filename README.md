Development of an environmental monitoring station
The objective of this project is to develop a weather station that can measure parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and cloud cover, and make this information publicly available through a Web page - preferably as a service provided through our department web page. The system must be robust enough to keep it running for many years with minimal manual interventions. Data must be archived, and facilities like plotting time series graphs must be made available to users. It can also be extended in two ways - by adding parameters related to air pollution and by adding more locations (outside Colombo).
